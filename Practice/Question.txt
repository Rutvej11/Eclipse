Library Management System
Objective: Create a system to manage a libraryâ€™s books, members, and staff, which should allow for adding, removing, and updating books. It should also manage members and issue books.

Questions/Tasks:

OOP Concepts:
Design classes for Book, Member, Staff, and Library.
Implement inheritance where Member and Staff classes inherit from a common Person class.
Use encapsulation for member variables, and implement constructors, getters, and setters.
Collections Framework:
Use ArrayList to store Book objects and HashMap to map Member objects with issued books.
Store all overdue books in a HashSet.
Stream API:
Find and display all books that have been issued for over a month.
Filter and display all books by a specific author using Stream.
Serialization:
Serialize and save the library data to a file before the program closes, and deserialize it when the program starts.
Multithreading:
Create a thread that runs daily to check for overdue books and notifies members by printing a message.
Use multithreading to allow multiple staff members to update book information simultaneously.
